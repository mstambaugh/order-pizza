## Specifications

| Behavior | Input | Expected Output |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|The program collects a user inputted string for name and number which are stored but not displayed to the user| "Molly" "555-5555" | "Molly" "555-5555" |
|The program gives drop down box options with assigned values for size, type of pizza, and crust| "style" "size" "crust" | "2" "14" " " |
|The program parseInts user inputs for size and type and assigns them to a new Pizza object| "2" "14" | 2 14 |
|The program's Pizza object constructor runs three prototype methods to add these two key value pairs, size and type, generating a third key value pair, pizza.total| 2 14 | 16 |
|The program returns the value of pizza.total, assigns it to a new variable, and displays it to the page in a span| 16 | "16" |
